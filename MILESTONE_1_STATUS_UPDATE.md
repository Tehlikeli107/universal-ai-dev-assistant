## 🧪 TESTING STATUS

### Demo Script Results
```bash
python scripts/evals/run_milestone1_demo.py
```
**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Health Check: API responsive with provider status
- ✅ Code Completion: Working with Ollama/Heuristic fallback
- ✅ Code Analysis: Security and quality issue detection
- ✅ Agent Planning: Goal → execution plan generation
- ✅ Patch Generation: Code modification with metrics
- ✅ Metrics: Prometheus endpoint with telemetry

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend && cargo run

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/plan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"goal": "Add input validation", "constraints": {"max_files": 5}}'
```
